# PoliticsFreeNews
Today, we have the tools to reasonably categorize news on an ideological spectrum from conservative to liberal based on author, news source, title, and language used in the article. By assigning users a diversity score (based on a preferences quiz), we can nudge users towards more moderate viewpoints by gradually centralizing their news on our platform. Furthermore, by abstracting news articles (i.e. “News about Gun Control” vs. “Is Chicago Proof that Gun Laws Don’t Work”) we can prevent clickbait titles that push users towards less diverse news. We will be collecting and categorizing real-time news data from social media and common news sources. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a trustworthy set of news for readers in order to counter the echo chambers that we see on Facebook and other social media services by efficiently organizing information from unreliable or diversified sources.
